Overview:
The Invoice Generation System is a simple web-based tool that allows users to create invoices by adding multiple items with their descriptions, quantities, and prices. The system calculates the total price for each item, applies a 10% tax, and displays the final invoice with the subtotal, tax, and total amount. It also provides an option to download or print the generated invoice.
